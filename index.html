                <p>"Dan and I trained together for several years and I cannot say enough good things about him. I
                    trained with him towards the end of my 13-year professional career and he understood exactly what
                    was needed for me, to not only maintain great physical health, but continued to challenge me by
                    getting me out of my comfort zone which allowed me to compete with the younger generation. His
                    ability to modify the workout regimen specific to my strengths and weaknesses in alignment with our
                    goals is second to none. The cookie cutter training program does not work for athletes at my level.
                    Dan is able to understand the specific needs and wants of each of his athletes, sets mutually agreed
                    upon goals and expectations, and keeps us accountable on a daily basis. Dan is able to execute
                    strength training, conditioning, skillwork, nutritional guidance, recovery, etc. at an elite level
                    which is a MUST for professional athletes. He earned 100% of my trust."
