        <p>"Dan and I trained together for several years and I cannot say enough good things about him.  I trained with him towards the end of my 13-year professional career and he understood exactly what was needed for me, to not only maintain great physical health, but continued to challenge me by getting me out of my comfort zone which allowed me to compete with the younger generation.  His ability to modify the workout regimen specific to my strengths and weaknesses in alignment with our goals is second to none.  The cookie cutter training program does not work for athletes at my level.  Dan is able to understand the specific needs and wants of each of his athletes, sets mutually agreed upon goals and expectations, and keeps us accountable on a daily basis. Dan is able to execute strength training, conditioning, skillwork, nutritional guidance, recovery, etc. at an elite level which is a MUST for professional athletes.  He earned 100% of my trust.

        <p>"Dan did an amazing job rebuilding the muscles and movements that I lost after taking off 2 years. He did a great job working with my schedule and pushing me when he knew I could handle it and taking it easy when my schedule didn't allow it. Without Dan I wouldn't have been able to get back to the high speed of the season. I would recommend anyone trying to play at the next level to work with him. "</p>

        <p>"Dan, maximizes every single one of his client’s potential in the weight room. My most dramatic summer improvements as an athlete came from working with Dan. Dan made me more powerful, explosive, and quicker. My only regret is not training with him throughout my whole career. He pushes you to limits as an athlete that are needed in order to succeed at the highest levels of your sport."</p>

        <p>"After working with Dan for a full  summer I can easily say it was the best thing I’ve done for my athletic career. Dan's focus and passion for his work made My workouts and rehabs are very easy to understand and execute. Walking into the gym everyday Dan had a plan for me and a great system in place where I as an athlete only had to worry about working hard. I never had to worry about if I was on the right plan because Dan tracked my progress over the entire summer and we saw significant progress. When I returned to school at the end of the summer I tested the best in the weight room in my career. Going into my 5th year of college I didn’t think I would see too many changes with my testing numbers but after a summer following and listening to Dan I took huge steps in the weightroom. Without Dan's training this past summer I don’t know where I would be as an athlete and it is safe to say that I would definitely work with Dan again in the future and recommend him to all other athletes looking to take their training to the next level."</p>
