        <h5>Colin Mcdonald</h5>
        <p>Dan and I trained together for several years and I cannot say enough good things about him.  I trained with him towards the end of my 13-year professional career and he understood exactly what was needed for me, to not only maintain great physical health, but continued to challenge me by getting me out of my comfort zone which allowed me to compete with the younger generation.  His ability to modify the workout regimen specific to my strengths and weaknesses in alignment with our goals is second to none.  The cookie cutter training program does not work for athletes at my level.  Dan is able to understand the specific needs and wants of each of his athletes, sets mutually agreed upon goals and expectations, and keeps us accountable on a daily basis. Dan is able to execute strength training, conditioning, skillwork, nutritional guidance, recovery, etc. at an elite level which is a MUST for professional athletes.  He earned 100% of my trust.   </p>

        <h5>Bobby Butler </h5>
        <p>Dan did an amazing job rebuilding the muscles and movements that I lost after taking off 2 years. He did a great job working with my schedule and pushing me when he knew I could handle it and taking it easy when my schedule didn't allow it. Without Dan I wouldn't have been able to get back to the high speed of the season. I would recommend anyone trying to play at the next level to work with him. </p>

        <h5>Alex Vlasic </h5>
        <p>During my time at BU, Dan had an enormous positive impact on my development. He always had my health and safety as a priority while still getting the most out of my physical capabilities. He was a big contributor to my success at BU and helped me get to where I’m at now.</p>

        <h5>TJ Walsh </h5>
        <p>I've been working with Dan for the past 6 years and he has helped me tons in developing my strength, mobility, conditioning, and recovery. I've had some serious injuries that Dan has helped me rehab from and got me back to playing. He's a top notch strength coach with extreme knowledge in strength training and injury prevention</p>

        <h5>Jack Quinlavan </h5>
        <p>Dan, maximizes every single one of his client’s potential in the weight room. My most dramatic summer improvements as an athlete came from working with Dan. Dan made me more powerful, explosive, and quicker. My only regret is not training with him throughout my whole career. He pushes you to limits as an athlete that are needed in order to succeed at the highest levels of your sport.</p>

        <h5>Case Mccarthy</h5>
        <p>Dan was a key part of our staff at BU.  He got us ready every week, translating off-ice training to on-ice performance.  He brought the energy every day, gaining the respect and building relationships with myself and the whole team.</p>

        <h5>Thomas Porrel </h5>
        <p>For the past 5 years I have been training with Dan and it has been a huge part of my success and progress. He made sure I was ready for the season by working on the little extra things that help separate me and also improving my weakest areas physically. He has helped me rehab my shoulder after surgery and many other small issues/injuries. I would highly recommend Dan to any athlete at any level as he has helped get to where I am today.</p>

        <h5>Chris Campbell </h5>
        <p>After working with Dan for a full  summer I can easily say it was the best thing I’ve done for my athletic career. Dan's focus and passion for his work made My workouts and rehabs are very easy to understand and execute. Walking into the gym everyday Dan had a plan for me and a great system in place where I as an athlete only had to worry about working hard. I never had to worry about if I was on the right plan because Dan tracked my progress over the entire summer and we saw significant progress. When I returned to school at the end of the summer I tested the best in the weight room in my career. Going into my 5th year of college I didn’t think I would see too many changes with my testing numbers but after a summer following and listening to Dan I took huge steps in the weightroom. Without Dan's training this past summer I don’t know where I would be as an athlete and it is safe to say that I would definitely work with Dan again in the future and recommend him to all other athletes looking to take their training to the next level.</p>
